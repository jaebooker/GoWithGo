We propose to build a Go game engine, which will be able to handle millions of sockets, perhaps utilizing Leap. People will be able to play with other people, or play with a go bot.

The Go bot will be made using Facebook's open-source machine-learning platform that can beat several high-level players.

Sound difficult? Probably.
